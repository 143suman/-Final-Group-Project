<p><b>TOURIST`S DESTINATION:</b> <br>Blessed with natural beauty and rich history Nuwakot is one of Nepal’s best-hidden secrets. Away from the herds of tourists and tourism activities, visitors can have a real taste of Nepal and witness the spectacular sunset and sunrise from Kakani hill Tower. With just handful of hotels and resorts, the tiny village of Nuwakot or Nine forts has gained its reputation as the silent peak of the region. Although the place is easily accessible from Kathmandu, it is lesser popular than the hilltops of Pokhara and Nagarkot. With snow-capped mountains and thick clouds surrounding the hilltop, Nuwakot was formerly a royal base with Prithvi Narayan Shah who landed here in the year 1744 and made a strategy to conquer Kathmandu and later founded the Shah Dynasty which ruled the country for 240 years, until 2008 when Nepal transformed into republic and monarchy was abolished. Nuwakot palace square which was built by the then king has become the center of attraction for the tourists visiting this pristine hill town. This straight out of the dream town also practices its own customs which keep both locals and tourists entertained. A couple of their many uniquely popular festivals is Bullfighting and Sindure Jatra. For all the tourists traveling to Nepal must include Nuwakot in their itinerary and explore this little Nepal within Nepal. </p>

<p style="color:red;">The name, 'Nuwakot', is made up of two words 'nawa' and 'kort'. 'Nawa' means nine in Nepali and 'kort' means sacred religious sites at the top of hill. The district accordingly has nine hills over which various deities are said to dwell thus overseeing and protecting Nuwakot. This has led Nuwakot often being called "City of nine hills". The Gorkhali king Prithivi Narayan Shah invaded Nuwakot which was under the ruling of Jaya Prakash Malla and made Nuwakot the capital of his kingdom.
